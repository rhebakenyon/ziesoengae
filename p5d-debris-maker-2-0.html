                            <p> I downloaded the Debris Maker 2 script, made a simple brick and went to apply a material. For whatever reason it applies it as a solid colour, if I make a cube from the right hand side object list, it applies the texture correctly. What am I doing wrong here please? Image: https://i.imgur.com/XBj4W7s.png. (https://imgur.com/a/kNDNZj0) Intro This is my first review and first new purchase from a Viberg stockist. Lot of firsts here! I caught the bug last January, buying a used Viberg aged bark service boot in the 2030 last and a cordovan C&J dundee in the 335 last from the B/S/T threads. I was inspired to get this makeup or something similar when I saw the captoe 2030 version of it as part of the Viberg sample sale proxy group this month. With the boot out of my size and unavailable. Hello there, home improvers. A few days ago many of you were kind enough to offer “new home owner” advice OP (https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/ayx9cq/new_home_owner_todo_list/). I’ve gone ahead and aggregated the bulk of your responses, and came up with this post after conducting some research. I’ve loosely categorized the various items to aid in focus. The time estimates are loose guesses, but could definitely change if you have a stubborn project or issues with access. Dave sighed heavily as he walked down the hallway of the generation ship "Dauntless" towards the lower living quarters. "You are respiring heavily again DAVE, which indicates you may be experiencing negative emotions." Dave winced at the slightly off pitch recreation of human speech patterns emitting from the android walking next to him. He sourly mused to himself that the fact every single android didn't get speech quite right was most likely on purpose. He reminded himself A year ago I applied to work at a local hackerspace. I interned for 2 years at a hackerspace in my home town, and even had a letter of rec from my old boss who founded the hackerspace. I knew how to operate, fix, and instruct others to use 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, etc. If you’ve ever been to a hacker or maker space you know there’s equipment that’s pretty standardized- and I know how to use all of it. So my interview came around and I was excited. It seemed 
Above It was in the light. Hard baked into that holy radiance flowing perpetually from the almighty creator beyond the great veil. Camael could feel the time eminent. All the angels could. The arcs that led them sang the praises of the lord, bathed in the glowing pillar that blessed them. Their song changed. The time for praising the lord was over, the time for action in his name had come. The host armed itself. A million angels cheered as the vanguard took up their weapons, blessed.

I've been using a 0 Ridgid Table saw (new from Home Depot, model R45171) ever since I've started 7 months ago. It's been good to me so far and I have been able to do the things I wanted to. I've recently got one of those digital angle finders where you put the magnetic base on the blade and see what bevel angle you're at. I noticed that even when I crank it as far as I could to tilt the blade

Roberto's life radically changed when his powers manifested in the middle of a soccer game, outing him publicly as a mutant. Although Roberto's dreams of inheriting millions and playing soccer at the Olympics were dashed, he little realized Hi everyone. My name i- \ Not your real name Miss. \ Oh. Right.

This is an intro, not a talk show where everyone talks over each other. So, please, just let me tell this story. Anyways, you all can call me.Lyca. I've always liked that name. Also, you may want to put aside some time for this. This may take a bit to read. Hello all. I'm new to farming and starting small with 9 acres. At my disposal i have a JD 6430 and JD 5420. As for implements, I have a 4 bottom 2 way plow, and 2 older model 11 foot disc cultivators as well as a plastic mulch/drip tape layer. My fields(pasture grass and alfalfa in sandy loam) have been plowed to ~12inches deep and thouroughly disc cultivated. The problem is the root balls are so plentiful they are interfering with the proper operation of the plastic mulch layer/seed bed maker. Climbing helmets (https://www.oemhelmet.com/) are designed to protect you against several common climbing scenarios; for example, when: rocks or hardware get kicked loose above you you peel off and whip into a wall you hit your head on an overhang All helmets must meet industry standards for impact protection, with the standard (https://www.oemhelmet.com/helmet-standard)for overhead protection being greater than the side-protection standard. Getting the right helmet involves three. My friends and I had developed a love of diving growing up in Lake Worth, Florida. Ben was my best friend, and Sadie, his girlfriend, had introduced me to Samantha, the love of my life. Red haired and vibrant, she was happily obnoxious in a way I found endearing. We had spent the past nine years together. I say was because her mother, a venerable old hippie, passed away after a long, brutal battle with Alzheimers that took its toll on all of us. She had slowly stopped diving

Date: March 21st, 2189 Location: 31,123,000 Light years from earth in the Sombrero Galaxy Log: This is Hannah Meadows, A-class grade 2 pilot of the commercial repair and rescue ship, the Lighthouse . I suppose I didn’t have to write that, seeing how probably no one will ever read this log, but it’s not every day a girl does so well on her upgrade test that she immediately jumps from a grade 5 to a grade 2, and almost immediately after that gets hired to pilot such a famous ship. I freely admit that along with my perfume habit, I have an issue with hoarding bath and body products. It's kind of always been my thing, even back in the 90's I was a preteen who spent most of my allowance in BBW and VS buying lotions and potions of all sorts. So having tried a crap ton of indie brands at this point, I thought I would review some of them in case anyone was interested. Disclosure: I am late 30's with super dry skin all over (including my hair and scalp). I don't mind greasy. These are three quick snapshots of a world my friend and I were considering starting to develop. Though that never took off, I still kinda like these. I've been considering getting more seriously into writing my own stuff and would like to get some gut reactions from you on these. Go as deep as you want in your feedback, and know that I can handle a decent amount of critique, as long as it is constructive. I am most interested to hear what your impression of the world we were creating Any answer possible? I'm not sure there is. The South side is important because that's where they all approached from on the 8th, and the dog was chained to the North. Eisenberg says she doesn't know what Strang is talking about when he asks about the fragment south of the pit. He suggests maybe it was mixed under another tag but there's no reply. Ertl stated that on the 8th they only processed the burned area itself. Sturdivant seems reluctant to discuss the processing ______ THE DAY ITSELF – EVIDENCE OF COMPLICITY ______ 1. AWOL Chain of Command a. It is well documented that the officials topping the chain of command for response to a domestic attack – George W.
