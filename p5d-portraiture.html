Portrait photography (cosplay, boudoir, outdoor action, etc) has become my primary hobby over the past few months and my current setup is a Canon Rebel T7i with a Canon EF 50mm 1.8 STM lens. It's an incredible entry-level setup and I love the photos I've been taking with it (I also occasionally use the Canon 24mm 2.4 pancake lens if I want a wider angle). Howeve. Is it because it represented realism? What really is the reason. My lgbtq art teacher looks me straight in the eye and assigns the girl I like to teach my gay ass how to make a portraiture.

Hello everyone. I'm debating with myself over the last couple of weeks if I should stay with my Sony 55 1.8 or switch to the Batis 40/2 and would like to hear your opinion.

I was told it was was basically to study some differences between planned filming in a controlled environment and live filming of a live performance. It's not the biggest I read somewhere that Ilford Delta 100 is not good for portraiture just because it delivers compressed midtones. What does compressed midtones look like? Why is it bad for portraits. I will be doing a free outdoor engagement shoot in Northern California this upcoming summer, and I am trying to plan the gear that would be best for this kind of shoot. I have a small amount of experience in portraiture and couples photography but can practice and learn the fundamentals before summer. At the moment, I am planning to use the equipment below for the shoot, is there any additional gear I should rent/borrow/purchase? Also, are there any skills I should focus on while practicing. Is it because it is a more of a realistic portrayal? Is it the best way to pprtray a character type? What are the real reasons.
